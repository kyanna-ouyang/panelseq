Two methods:
1. For samples where the variant was called: vcf files
- Navigate to INFO column and look for the following fields:
- DP: read depth for tier1 (used+filtered)
- FDP: number of basecalls filtered from original read depth for tier1
- AU, CU, GU and TU: number of 'A/C/G/T' alleles used in tiers 1,2
- Frequency of variant = count of ALT nucleotide / (DP-FDP)

2. For samples where the variant was not called: Integrative Genome Viewer (IGF)
- Drag and drop corresponding bam and bai files of each sample
- Navigate to position in genome where variant is found
- Double click on base to display total count and counts of A/C/G/T
- Frequency of variant = count of ALT nucleotide / total count
